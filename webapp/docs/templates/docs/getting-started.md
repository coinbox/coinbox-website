Flask-Admin
===========

Here.... And there

Introduction
------------

This is library for building adminstrative interface on top of Flask framework.

Instead of providing simple scaffolding for the SQLAlchemy models, Flask-Admin
provides tools that can be used to build adminstrative interface of any complexity,
using consistent look and feel.

Small example (Flask initialization omitted)::

    app = Flask(__name__)

    admin = Admin()
    admin.add_view(ModelView(User, db.session))
    admin.add_view(GalleryManager(name='Photos', category='Cats'))
    admin.init_app(app)
